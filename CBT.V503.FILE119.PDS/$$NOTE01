Sam,

Please find attached an updated copy of the assembler source for
the TSO CP command  SM", which allows for dynamic  off and on" of
the TSO Session Manager.  Yes, it assembles cleanly, and I still
use the Session Manager!  Not a line of code was modified (with
the exception of new comments and some superficial cleanup with
attached assembly JCL).  The LOGON WORK AREA DSECT, IKJEFLWA, is
no longer in  Private Macs":  It may be found in SYS1.MODGEN.
Just type 'SM' from the TSO READY prompt after having logged on
TSO with SM defined (EXEC PGM=ADFMDF03 + PARM) in your LOGON
procedure.  I could not find the HELP text (which I wrote) for
this command.  Time permitting, I may rewrite it.

This TSO CP REQUIRES for assembly some macros in FILE119 from
which I extracted the source.  Howard Dean and I contributed SM
to the tape in 1985 when we were employed at SYNTEX (USA) in Palo
Alto, CA.

I wonder what ever happened to Howard Dean.  Maybe a question for
IBM-MAIN?
