      SUBJECT:  Change Request #7002 - DASD SUBPOOL ALLOCATION


      LIS has opened Change Request #7002.  This change asks CIS to develop a
      method which will allow users to allocate new datasets, on appropriate
      DASD volumes, without specifying a volume serial ID.  For the sake of
      convenience, I will refer to this change as "SUBPOOL ALLOCATION" for the
      remainder of this discussion. The purpose of this document is to provide
      background information explaining the need for SUBPOOL ALLOCATION, and
      to define the technical requirements which must be satisfied.

      The changes described in this memorandum are intended to be compatible
      with existing JCL, TSO commands, and CLISTS.  TSO commands and CLISTS
      that use dynamic, non-specific allocation will require no changes to
      take advantage of SUBPOOL ALLOCATION benefits.  Batch users will need to
      update their JCL before they can benefit from SUBPOOL ALLOCATION, but
      JCL changes will not be mandatory.  Dataset creation under INTERACT will
      be unaffected by this change.


      BACKGROUND
+     __________

      MVS allocation design restricts non-specific, non-temporary dataset
      allocation to "storage" volumes.  Today, only WORK volumes are mounted
      "storage", all other DASD are mounted "private".  MVS will allocate new
      datasets on "private" volumes only when specifically requested.

      Excluding the WORK volumes, we have seven unique DASD subpools available
      for user-allocated datasets.  Depending on the type of dataset to be
      created, users must select a volume from one of the following subpools
      when allocating new datasets:

      -  INTERACT           (5 x 3350 volumes)

      -  TSO                (5 x 3380 volumes)

      -  SAS                (6 x 3380 volumes)

      -  Production VSAM    (3 x 3380 volumes)

      -  Production NONVSAM (3 x 3380 volumes)

      -  User VSAM          (3 x 3380 volumes)

      -  User NONVSAM       (6 x 3380 volumes)

      I will refer to the above DASD subpools collectively as USER volumes
      throughout the rest of this memorandum.

      PROBLEM STATEMENT
+     _________________

      With the current system, all non-temporary dataset allocations must be
      specific (i.e., the user must request a specific volume).  TSO commands
      and CLISTS may request dynamic, non-specific allocations; however, these
      allocations are converted to specific requests by a system exit routine.
      This exit forces all non-specific requests for an individual user to
      allocate on a single volume; volume selection is based upon an arbitrary
      attribute assigned to each user's TSO account.

      The main problem with specific allocation is that requested volumes do
      not always contain adequate free space.  When a requested volume lacks
      sufficient space, dataset allocation fails and the job or transaction
      aborts.  Typically, someone must update JCL or modify a CLIST before the
      aborted task can be re-executed.  In other cases, usually involving
      dynamic allocation or program-generated JCL, the only practical solution
      is for CIS to create free space on the required volume by deleting or
      relocating existing datasets.

      Dependence upon specific allocation also complicates the process of
      managing DASD capacity within the USER subpools.  Whenever additional
      volumes are added to one of the USER subpools, JCL changes and/or TSO
      account changes are required before new volumes can be used effectively.
      Installing extra DASD does not automatically fix space problems.


      RECOMMENDATION AND BENEFITS
+     ___________________________

      To resolve our current DASD space allocation problems, I recommend we
      implement SUBPOOL ALLOCATION at the earliest possible date.

      From a user's perspective, the major benefit of SUBPOOL ALLOCATION will
      be simplified data management procedures and reduced abends because of
      out-of-space conditions.  Users will no longer be required to request
      specific volumes when creating new datasets.  Instead, they will request
      space within a designated subpool (identified by the unitname parameter
      they specify).  The operating system will search all volumes within the
      requested subpool to locate a volume with enough free space.  Users will
      not need to concern themselves with which volume is allocated, as long
      as they follow the recommended practice of cataloging all DASD datasets.

      Within CIS, the primary benefit will be more efficient DASD management
      and more cost-effective use of our DASD resource.  DASD space problems
      will be easier to resolve since users' JCL, CLISTS, etc. will not have
      to be changed to make use of newly-installed volumes.  New USER volumes
      can be used as soon as they are added to a subpool.  In addition, space
      allocation across all volumes within each subpool will be more evenly
      distributed; as a result, the percentage of total space allocated within
      the subpools can be increased.

      IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY
+     _______________________

      The following actions are required to implement SUBPOOL ALLOCATION:

      -  Define new esoteric unitnames for each USER and WORK subpool.  Refer
         to TABLE 1 for the proposed list of unitnames.

      -  Modify the JES exit 6 routine:   Direct all non-specific allocations
         to WORK volumes.  Refer to TABLE 2 for details.

      -  Modify the IEFDB401 exit routine:  Direct all dynamic, non-specific
         allocations to either TSO or WORK volumes.  Refer to TABLE 3 for
         details.

      -  Change the mount status of all USER DASD volumes from "private"
         to "storage".

      The disadvantage of this plan is that MVS operational and technical
      support procedures will be more complicated.  Standard MVS procedures
      for defining device subpools require that esoteric names be associated
      with device addresses.  If we use standard MVS facilities to implement
      SUBPOOL ALLOCATION, we will usually have to perform an EDTGEN (a subset
      of an MVS system generation) and system re-IPL whenever we reconfigure
      DASD volumes.

      MVS user-modifications are available which will allow changes to device
      subpool definitions without requiring a re-IPL.  If we choose to use
      these modifications, the operational disadvantages of SUBPOOL ALLOCATION
      will be insignificant.  *Censored* should decide whether it is better to
      depend upon standard MVS features, or to install user-modifications when
      implementing SUBPOOL ALLOCATION.


      SUMMARY
+     _______

      Please evaluate the technical and operational feasibility of this
      recommendation.  With your concurrence, the plan will be presented to
      all SYNTEX Information Systems groups on Monday, April 28.  I will
      develop a detailed implementation plan once user-community agreement
      has been obtained.
