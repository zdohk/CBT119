Hello Sam

Now I have a job as consultant for z/OS system programming and
mainframe storage.

Here the customer asked me for a command to clear screen within a
REXX.
So I tried member CLR3270 of file 119:
   - in the source, there are 55 lines twice included
       - after deletion the assembly was well done
   - the module works fine.

I attached the corrected Source of CLR3270 and for your
documentation a member with the deleted lines.
The member name is  CLR3270Z.

Please include the new Source to File 119.

Greetings from Germany
Andreas
