Gentlemen:

I seem to recall someone (Lionel?) asked for a TSO command to
clear a 3270 display.  By coincidence, I ran across Howard Dean's
code from 1985  . I reassembled and tested it with z/OS 2.1 RSU
1606, VISTA, and the TSO Session Manager  SM" command.  The code
is located on CBT FILE 119.  I did some trivial reformatting and
added some additional supporting inline documentation.  This CP
checks for Session Manager, ASCII devices, runs in 31 bit mode,
no APF, looks at 3270 SFs, and best of all:  it cleans the glass
better than Windex.

In memory of a dear friend and colleague, HMD, a superb sysprog.
I was told he passed away some time ago.  I haven't seen him
since Christmas dinner at my house in 1987.  If anyone knows
otherwise, please let me know.

I'll reship to Sam for inclusion on FILE 119.  I guess this code
could use a HELP member.

Bill
