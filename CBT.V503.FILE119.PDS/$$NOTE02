          Changes to this file:

1.  TSOENTER and TSOLEAVE were copied into this file from CBT File
    136, also from Howard Dean.  The original macros from this file
    were renamed as TSOENTEO and TSOLEAVO, so they are still here
    if you need them in their original form.  The newer macro versions
    take XA and RMODE and AMODE into account, whereas the old versions
    do not.    (SBG - 2013/05/06)

    These macros are needed by the DOPROGL program in CBT File 300.
